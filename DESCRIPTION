Description: Program uses method of polynomial of variable degrees to interpolate gridded data preserving monotonicity and/or convexity or none. Method is implemented for univariate and bivariate cases. If values of derivatives are provided, spline will fix them,if not program will estimate them numerically. Package written purely in R.
